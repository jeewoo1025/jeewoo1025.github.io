I spent two years pursuing my master's degree at Hanyang University, focusing on natural language processing and large language models (LLMs). Since February 2024, I've been working as an AI Research Engineer at LG Electronics' AI Lab in Seoul, where I've been developing and deploying AI applications in real-world industrial settings. Having experienced both academic research and industry firsthand, I've naturally found myself thinking deeply about Korea's approach to AI. Here are some concerns that have been weighing on my mind lately.

#### Short-term thinking over fundamental problems

Korean AI research often remains fixated on immediate results. National research projects and corporate initiatives typically demand "visible outcomes" within tight timeframes, which leads to a focus on feature improvements that can be directly applied to services—like agentic frameworks—rather than tackling the fundamental limitations of foundation models. Unlike the US or China, where 5-10 year investments in basic research are more common, Korea tends to concentrate both human and physical resources on technologies that can show results within a few years. This structure makes it difficult to build long-term global competitiveness, which might explain why Korea still hovers around third place in AI competitiveness rankings despite significant efforts.

#### Missing the lessons from failure

Korea still carries a strong stigma around failure. When researchers don't achieve results, it's simply recorded as a "failure," often limiting future opportunities. In this environment, people naturally gravitate toward safe choices rather than challenging research. Overseas, however, teams and communities share lessons learned from failures, turning them into stepping stones for growth. Organizations like OpenAI and Google DeepMind reached their current achievements precisely because they treated countless failures and trial-and-error as learning assets. Korea needs this kind of culture and institutional support.

#### The commercial bias problem

It's also disappointing to see AI research and investment overwhelmingly concentrated in profitable areas. Coding assistance tools, financial services, and advertising recommendation systems attract substantial resources and talent because they can be monetized quickly. Meanwhile, socially valuable but less immediately profitable domains—like AI Safety and ethics—remain relatively neglected. This imbalance could ultimately hinder the balanced growth of Korea's AI ecosystem.

#### Final thoughts

From a junior researcher's perspective, Korean AI faces three intertwined challenges: short-term focus, failure avoidance, and commercial bias. Addressing these issues will require a fundamental shift in how we view AI as a society. But I wonder—can such change really take root in Korea's conservative culture?
