üëã Hello, I am Jeewoo Sul (ÏÑ§ÏßÄÏö∞).

I am an AI Research Engineer at LG Electronics' AI Lab (Seoul, Korea) since February 2024.

My goal is **to build AI systems that are reliable and beneficial**. 

I am currently developing AI systems that understand and interact with code using large language models (LLMs). My work explores how AI can support and optimize every stage of the software development lifecycle.

üîç Current Research Interests
- ***AI Coding Agent***: Enabling advanced code review, refactoring, comment generation, and more.
- ***LLM-as-a-Judge***: Utilizing large language models for robust evaluation of code quality and model performance.
- ***Prompt Engineering***: Designing and optimizing prompts to achieve high-performance, task specific outcomes.
- ***Reinforcement Learning***: Aligning models with developers' values and preferences.

üîô Past Research Experience

As a graduate student majoring in Computer Science at <a href="http://cse.hanyang.ac.kr/eng/">Hanyang University</a>, I conducted research in Natural Language Processing under the supervision of Prof. <a href='http://ai.hanyang.ac.kr/main'>Yong Suk Choi</a>, focusing on [Abstractive Text Summarization](https://aclanthology.org/2023.acl-short.56/) and [Prompt Tuning](https://aclanthology.org/2024.naacl-short.44/).
