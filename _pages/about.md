👋 Hello, I am Jeewoo Sul (설지우).

I am an AI Research Engineer at LG Electronics' AI Lab (Seoul, Korea) since February 2024. My goal is **to build AI systems that are reliable and beneficial**. I am currently developing AI Coding Agent using large language models (LLMs). My work explores how AI can support and optimize every stage of the software development lifecycle.

<br>

🔍 Current Research Interests
- ***LLM-as-a-Judge***: Utilizing large language models for robust evaluation of code quality and model performance.
- ***Prompt Engineering***: Designing and optimizing prompts (e.g., Persona, CoT) to achieve high-performance outcomes in software development features.
- ***Reflection Agent***: Exploring an adaptive multi-agent framework employing iterative self-reflection, verbal reinforcement, and collaborative simulation.

<br>

🔙 Past Research Experience <br>
As a graduate student majoring in Computer Science at <a href="http://cse.hanyang.ac.kr/eng/">Hanyang University</a>, I conducted research in Natural Language Processing under the supervision of Prof. <a href='http://ai.hanyang.ac.kr/main'>Yong Suk Choi</a>, focusing on [Abstractive Text Summarization](https://aclanthology.org/2023.acl-short.56/) and [Prompt Tuning](https://aclanthology.org/2024.naacl-short.44/).
