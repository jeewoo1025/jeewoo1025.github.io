👋 Hello, I am Jeewoo Sul (설지우).

🙏 I'm currently rebuilding my homepage. Please wait until it's done!

I am a research engineer at LG Electronics (Seoul, Korea), where I am affiliated with the AI Lab. I obtained my M.S. in Computer Science at [Hanyang University](https://www.hanyang.ac.kr/web/eng/home), where I was fortunate to be advised by [Yong Suk Choi](http://ai.hanyang.ac.kr/main). Prior to that, I received B.S. in Computer Science from [Kwangwoon University](https://www.kw.ac.kr/en/). 

My research lies in the area of natural language proessing with large language models. I had mainly studied Abstractive Summarization and Prompt Tuning (2022-2023). I am currently excited about AI Coding Assistants, Code LLMs, and Code Generation.
