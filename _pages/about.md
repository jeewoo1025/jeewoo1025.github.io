👋 Hello, I am Jeewoo Sul (설지우).

I am an AI Research Engineer at LG Electronics (Seoul, Korea) since February 2024. My goal is **to develop reliable AI that genuinely supports human needs**. I am currently developing AI Coding Agent using large language models (LLMs). My work explores how AI can support and optimize every stage of the software development lifecycle.

<br>

🔍 Current Research Interests
- ***Data-centric AI***: how can we engineer data that reflects human preferences?
- ***Human-AI Collaboration***: what does it take for AI agents to collaborate effectively with humans in real-world environments?

<br>

🔙 Past Research Experience <br>
As a master's student majoring in Computer Science at <a href="http://cse.hanyang.ac.kr/eng/">Hanyang University</a>, I conducted research in NLP and AI under the supervision of Prof. <a href='http://ai.hanyang.ac.kr/main'>Yong Suk Choi</a>, focusing on [Abstractive Text Summarization](https://aclanthology.org/2023.acl-short.56/) and [Prompt Transfer for QA](https://aclanthology.org/2024.naacl-short.44/).

<br>

🤗 I'm excited about potential collaborations — please don't hesitate to get in touch! <br>
